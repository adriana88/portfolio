							<h2>Adriana Wojtanowska</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a <b style="font-weight: 900;"> BI, Marketing & Data Specialist </b> with 5+ years of professional experience. 
							<br>
							<br>At Wolf Theiss, a leading Austrian law firm, I built stable data models and developed interactive <b style="font-weight: 900;"> Power BI dashboards </b> focused on strategic marketing KPIs. Additionally, I executed <b style="font-weight: 900;"> complex SQL queries </b>, provided senior lawyers with ad-hoc <b style="font-weight: 900;"> BI reports </b>, and was one of the primary CRM administrators overseeing the entire contact database. Furthermore, I led the implementation of new digital marketing software and managed campaigns and online content.
					                <br>
							<br>Since April 2024, I have been serving as a <b style="font-weight: 900;"> Data Analyst </b> for a major Austrian company in the building & construction industry where (so far) I have created a complex data model and a comprehensive, fully interactive Power BI dashboard integrating complex SQL queries.</p>

								<h3>Alexander A. Miklautz, Head of Marketing, PWC Austria</h3>
								<p>"I highly recommend Adriana as a colleague with exceptional expertise in data analysis and CRM. Her analytical skills are truly commendable, as she consistently delivers insightful and data-driven solutions. Adriana's proficiency in CRM systems is remarkable, making her an invaluable asset to any team aiming to optimize their customer relations strategies. Working with her has been both a pleasure and a learning experience, and I wholeheartedly endorse her for any role that demands a strong grasp of data analysis and CRM implementation."</p>

								<h3>John Thompson, Senior Copywriter & Content Specialist, Wolf Theiss</h3>
								<p>"I have worked for several years together with Adriana to market the firm's publications and and to track and analyse their performance. Two things stand out in particular regarding her work, a) her willingness to take on projects diligently and solve problems efficiently, and b) her responsiveness and professional attitude. We all have known colleagues that really pull more than their weight within the team and seek solutions rather than extending the work. That is Ada in a nutshell: getting things done well, quickly, professionally and even with a good laugh in between. My work would certainly be more difficult without Adriana on the team."</p>

								<h3>Akper Saryyev, Deputy Head of Advantage Austria in Zurich</h3>
								<p>"During my collaboration with Adriana, our teamwork was marked by a complementary dynamic. I was responsible for business development initiatives, while Adriana managed data and publications. Our close cooperation was characterized by her unwavering commitment to results. Adriana consistently demonstrated a keen ability to adhere to tight deadlines, a quality I highly valued. Even in high-pressure situations, she maintained a composed and focused approach, contributing significantly to our collective success."</p>

								<h3>Anna Szepietowska, Head of Marketing & PR, Kochański & Partners</h3>
								<p>I had the pleasure of working with Adriana at a time when I was head of marketing in Wolf Theiss' Warsaw office, and she was working in Vienna, in an international team providing BD support to all law firm's CEE offices. I was impressed not only by her language, communication and organizational skills, but by her comprehensive approach to many complex processes that worked differently in the various offices. Adriana is able not only to explain complex data processing issues, but also to find interesting solutions, looking several steps ahead of current expectations. She is very proficient and professional, works agilely, definitely knows how to use her experience in business practice.</p>
